# Toggle groups for SillyTavern

## Overview

Adds toggle groups for Chat Completion Presets that can target multiple entries at once.

## Features

- Seamless import and export to presets (only on newest staging for now)
- Four different possible behaviors for each target:
  1. Direct: Will copy the state of the main toggle
  2. Invert: Will copy the opposite of the main toggle
  3. Toggle: Will toggle states for each main toggle change
  4. Random: Will settle on a random state for each main toggle change

## Installation

## Usage
